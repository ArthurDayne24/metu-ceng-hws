\section*{Answer 2.17}
Let events :\\
 \textit{D=computer at hand has a defected part} \\
 \textit{X=supplier of computer at hand has been bought from X} \\
 \textit{Y=supplier of computer at hand has been bought from Y} \\
 \textit{Z=supplier of computer at hand has been bought from Z} \\ \\
where $$P(D)=P(D\cap X)+P(D\cap Y)+P(D\cap Z)$$ by total probability since $P(X)+P(Y)+P(Z)=1$ and events $X, Y, Z$ totally covers $D$.\\ \\
Our answer is $P(Z|D)$. By \textit{Bayes Rule} $$P(Z|D)=\dfrac{P(Z\cap D)}{P(D)}=\dfrac{P(Z\cap D)}{P(D\cap X)+P(D\cap Y)+P(D\cap Z)}$$\\ \\
Hence our answer is $$\dfrac{0.06*0.40}{0.05*0.24+0.10*0.36*0.06*0.40}=\dfrac{1}{3}$$ as each of $X, Y, Z$ are mutually exclusive with $D$.

\section*{Answer 2.29}

Let the answer be $P(x>=2)$. Also our sample space has $C(9, 5)$ many options. Here we choose $5$ possible places from $9$ for the databases containing given keyword where the order does not matter.\\ \\
To calculate $P(0)$, we want to choose $5$ places from the last $5$ places to put databases containing given keyword in only one way($C(5, 5)=1$). Hence $P(0)=\dfrac{1}{C(9, 5)}$.\\ \\
To calculate $P(1)$, we want to choose $4$ places from the last $5$ places to put databases containing given keyword, which can be done in $C(5, 4)=C(5, 1)=5$ many ways and $1$ place to put our only database containing the keyword in the first $4$, which can be done in $C(4, 1)=4$ many ways. Hence $P(1)= \dfrac{5*4}{C(9, 5)}= \dfrac{20}{C(9, 5)}$.\\ \\ 
Since $P(0),P(1) \dots P(4)$ are mutually exclusive, then answer is $P(x>=2)=1-(P(0)+P(1))=\dfrac{5}{6}$.

\section*{Answer 3.6}

Let $P(x=i)$ be the probability to counter with $i$ errors where $i=0$ or $i=1$. For $P(0)$, we check to find $0$-error block in each tests. In first trial, we have $\dfrac{5}{6}$ probability for first test and have $\dfrac{4}{5}$ probability for second test as only one of the blocks has error. Then $P(0)=\dfrac{5*4}{6*5}=\dfrac{2}{3}$. For $P(1)$, we search to find $1$-error block at first or second test, but not both of them. In first trial, we have $\dfrac{5}{6}$ probability for first test to be $0$-error and have $\dfrac{1}{5}$ probability for second test to have $1$ error, where first and second tests can be replaced. Then $P(1)=2\dfrac{5}{6}\dfrac{1}{5}=\dfrac{1}{3}$.\\ \\
$E(X)=0P(0)+1P(1)=\dfrac{1}{3}$


\section*{Answer 3.7}

Name random variables for distributions of games seperately as $P_{x_{1}}(x)$, $P_{x_{2}}(x)$ and for overall home runs as $P_{y}(x)$.\\ \\
Compute $P(y)$s for all y values:
\begin{align*}
	P_{y}(0) & = P_{x_{1}}(0)P_{x_{2}}(0) & = 0.4^2 \\
	P_{y}(1) & = P_{x_{1}}(0)P_{x_{2}}(1) + P_{x_{1}}(1)P_{x_{2}}(0) & = 2(0.4^2) \\
	P_{y}(2) & = P_{x_{1}}(0)P_{x_{2}}(2) + P_{x_{1}}(1)P_{x_{2}}(1) + P_{x_{1}}(2)P_{x_{2}}(0)& = 2(0.4)(0.2)+0.4^2 \\
	P_{y}(3) & = P_{x_{1}}(1)P_{x_{2}}(2) + P_{x_{1}}(2)P_{x_{2}}(1) & = 2(0.2)(0.4) \\
	P_{y}(4) & = P_{x_{1}}(2)P_{x_{2}}(2) & = 0.2^2
\end{align*}

Hence $\mu=E(Y)=0P_y(0)+1P_y(1)+2P_y(2)+3P(3)+4P_y(4)=1.6$.\\
Then $Var(Y)=\sum_{k=0}^4(x_k-\mu)^2P_y(x_k)=1.12$
