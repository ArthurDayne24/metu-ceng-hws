we have written a script to be run in source and destination nodes to synchronize using ntp
but we have decided not to use it as mentioned in the report

before running these delay scripts change the delay number.

run "sh brokerDelay.sh" on broker node
run "sh router1Delay.sh" on router1 node
run "sh router2Delay.sh" on router2 node
run "sh destDelay.sh" on destination node

you may change port number in commons.py

run "python3.5 BrokerNode.py" on broker node
run "python3.5 RouterNode1.py" on router1 node
run "python3.5 RouterNode2.py" on router2 node
run "python3.5 DestinationNode.py" on destination node
run "python3.5 SourceNode.py" on source node
