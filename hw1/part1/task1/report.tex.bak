\section{CBC Mode}
\par
In CBC mode, each block of plaintext is first $xor$'ed by previous ciphertext block 
retrieved by encryption of previous plaintext block and then encrypted by \textit{key}.
This brings us the \textit{diffusion} property.
\par
Even if we have a trivial plain-image like "original.bmp", we cannot deduce any
useful information in first glance to the cipher-image as it seems much like noise.
Noiseness comes directly from "cipher block chaining".

\section{ECB Mode}
\par
In ECB mode, each block is encrypted indepently from the other blocks.
ECB mode does not utilize any feedbacks from previous blocks unlike some other
modes (like CBC Mode). Regardless of its position, a plaintext block 
is always encrypted to same ciphertext block. Hence ECB Mode cannot
satisfy \textit{diffueion} property.
\par
Near pixels have same RGB values if the input image is not that complex
due to the reasons explained above.
Hence we may deduce some or most parts of underlying plain-image, its rough shape and 
even the objects in image depending on the 
color-wise complexity of given plain-image.
