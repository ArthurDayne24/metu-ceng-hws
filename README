0) Run ./putToServers.sh to put necessary scripts to related nodes. This file is configured up to our geni ssh user/port pairs.

1) Run ./setntp.sh                      at source and destination to make time synchronized.

2) Run sudo ./configAtBroker.sh         at broker to set routing logic
   Run sudo ./configAtDestination.sh    at destination to set routing logic

3) Run ./experimental_<NODE_NAME>.sh <EXPERIMENT> at each corresponding node to set netem/tc settings for experiments as following:
   For example:
     at broker node, run "sudo ./experimental_broker 1.1" for experiment 1.1
     at router1 node, run "sudo ./experimental_router1 1.1" for experiment 1.1
     at router2 node, run "sudo ./experimental_router2 1.1" for experiment 1.1
     at destination node, run "sudo ./experimental_destination 1.1" for experiment 1.1

   <EXPERIMENT> can be one of the [1.1, 1.2, 1.3,.. 3.3]
   <EXPERIMENT> can be set to "clear" without quotes to reset netem/tc settings

4) Run BrokerNode.py at broker node.
   Run DestinationNode.py at destination node.
   Run SourceNode.py at source node.

5) After file transfer is done, at source node and destination node, timestamps are printed.
   Difference between these timestamps is the measurement of how much time passed for file transmission in seconds

6) Close scripts by Ctrl+C at source, broker and destination nodes.
